# Prompt - Ruby

## Hashes

### Objectives

1. Learn about hashes in Ruby.

### Instructions

Research and then write answers to the following questions in **lib/hashes.md**.

- What is a Hash?
- What are some examples of information that would be Hashes as opposed to some other data type?
- How are Hashes and Arrays similar? How are they different?
- How do you retrieve a particular value from a Hash?
- How do you add information to a Hash?
- How would you perform an operation on every element inside a Hash?
- How would you change the value of a particular element in a Hash?
- How do you delete an element from a Hash?
- What happens if you try to retrieve an element from a Hash that does not exist in the Hash?
- How do you determine how many elements are in a Hash?

Remember two things:

1. You don't need to submit any code to us for this assignment. Just provide in-your-own-words answers for the questions above.
2. We're not looking for any kind of advanced writing skills nor any kind of length. Just be clear and thoughtful about what you write--organize it however it makes sense for you.

### Resources

As always, one resource is Google. Some of the questions above can by entered verbatim into a Google search, and for others that won't be as effective. Either way, expect to read (or watch videos) about more than just the simple answer to each question. Often a question's answer--even one that seems short or simple--doesn't really make sense until after you've read the paragraphs before and after it.
